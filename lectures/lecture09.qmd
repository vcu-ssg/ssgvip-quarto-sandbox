## Housekeeping

- This week we focus on mockups and prototypes
- Expect some iteration with your storyboard!
- Homework 4 due Sunday (early credit for Friday)


## Concepts and considerations {.smaller}

1. Usability: designing interfaces that are easy to use and understand

1. Interaction design: creating interfaces that enable natural and efficient interaction with users

1. Visual design: using color, typography, and other visual elements to create aesthetically pleasing and functional interfaces

1. User-centered design: putting the needs and goals of users at the center of design decisions

1. Information architecture: organizing and structuring information in a way that supports users' needs and goals

1. Accessibility: ensuring that interfaces can be used by people with disabilities

1. User testing and feedback: evaluating interfaces through user testing and incorporating feedback to improve design.


## Practice {.smaller}

:::{.column}

**Problem**: I struggle to recall student names. It's kind of embarrasing.

To help, Banner provides
instructors with a picture list of faces (JPG are findable.) This isn't enough!

There has to be a better way!  :cry:
