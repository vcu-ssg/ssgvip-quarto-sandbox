    - Individual project - Figma-tize your resume
- Homework 1 and POGIL 1 still being graded. We'll be slow as we get warmed up.

## Homework 1 discussion

- Hard? Easy?
- How can instructions be improved?
- Did you google for instructions? In class I saw many getting frustrated.
- Mac instructions ... TMI? Just right?
