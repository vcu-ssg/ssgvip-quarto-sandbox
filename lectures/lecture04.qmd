# Issue using GIT CLONE

## Problem - Can't clone repo from CLI

## SSH private and public keys

## Solution - share your public key

### High level steps

1. Use SSH keygen to create keys
1. Copy public key to clipboard
1. Visit GITHUB user (not repo) settings
1. Add SSH key to GITHUB
1. Clone repo using command line

## Step 1: SSH keygen to create keys

::::{.columns layout-valign="top"}

:::{.column width="40%"}

ssh-keygen from CLI

- default *enter* to all prompts

- look in ~/.ssh folder

:::

:::{.column width="60%"}
![](assets/ssh-keygen-example1.png){vertical-align="top"}

## Step 2: Copy public key to clipboard

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}

type (cat) PUB file to screen
do it again, piping to clipboard

| clip.exe (on PC)

| pbclip (on Mac)

:::

:::{.column width="60%"}

## Step 3: Visit GITHUB user settings

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

## Step 4: Retry clone - Success!

**Problem**: I struggle to recall student names. It's kind of embarrasing.

To help, Banner provides
instructors with a picture list of faces (JPG are findable.) This isn't enough!

There has to be a better way!  :cry:

## Practice

### Well ...

- (what now?)


## Practice 

| Discover | Define | Develop | Deliver |
|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|

## {background-color="black"}

### Final thoughts

- Bring ideas for each step on Friday!

- Questions? :question:    Post to discord! :grin:
